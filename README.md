# skylake

I maintained my workspace on a Digitalocean VM and accessed it via [Akurath](https://aravindvoggu.in/setup-codebox-cloud-ide-on-digitalocean-and-develop-linux-applications-on-macos-windows-457682345e70).
The workspace was available at domain skylake.cf, hence the name.

This repo also has files related to OS course after Midsem. MIT Licensed.
